# adaptive-engine

This repository contains the adaptive engine to be used in a Microsoft EdX course (DAT222x) in Fall 2017, along with prototypes and documentation.

## Contents
In this repo:
* `app/` - Adaptive engine web application (python/django) code
* `data/` - data for engine initialization and data processing/transform scripts
* `monitoring/` - terraform files for setting up cloudwatch alarms on an elastic beanstalk deployment
* `python_prototype/` - python prototype for adaptive engine
* `r_prototype/` - R prototype for adaptive engine
* `tests/` - Testing scripts, including load testing with Locust
* `writeup/` - Writeup and LaTeX files to generate the document

## Running the engine application locally


Download the code:
```
# clone the repo locally
git clone https://github.com/harvard-vpal/adaptive-engine

# change into app directory
cd app
```

Run directly - You will likely want to set up a python virtual environment beforehand. See [conda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/) for details.

```
# install dependencies for local development
pip install -r requirements_local.py

# run database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations

# start the app
python manage.py runserver
```

Or you can use docker:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose_local.yaml up
```

The engine should now be available at localhost:8000. Try opening localhost:8000/engine/api in a web browser.

## Running tests
[Django unit tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/overview/) in `app/tests` can be run using
```
python manage.py test
```

## Running model update
There is a custom django-admin command to update the engine model. One approach for automating the model update is to set up a cron job - for example (update model every 2 hours):
```
0 */2 * * * docker run app python manage.py update_model --eta=0.0 --M=20.0 --settings=config.settings.eb_prod
```
